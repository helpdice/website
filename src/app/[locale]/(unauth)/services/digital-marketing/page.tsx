          question: "How will you create content perfect for my business ?",
          answer: `We start with a detailed questionnaire to learn about your
                content expectations and desires. Then we develop a strong
                social media strategy that can be executed with your needs in
                mind. Once you approve the strategy, we will put together a
                social media content calendar to see in advance what you will be
                publishing. You can review all content before it's put online.
                This organization method means you can get ahead of your social
                media posts and take into account upcoming holidays, promotions,
                and other special events.`
        },
        {
          question: "Do I have to provide you with content?",
          answer: `We welcome any content already created but don't worry if you
                need more. Your social media account manager will provide fresh
                content and we have a great team of writers, designers and
                access to stock photography libraries and relevant news sources.
                We can even help you organize photography and video shoots if
                you wish to have an ongoing supply of original content. For
                example, a one-day photoshoot can be planned to take care of
                your image content for many months in advance.`

        {
          question: "How will you grow my followers?",
          answer: `Through organic and paid methods, we grow your loyal followers.
                Some examples of how we increase followers are by researching
                your competitor audience, creating engaging content and engaging
                with your audience. When using a paid approach, we set an
                advertising budget to suit your needs.`
        },
        {
          question: "Do you monitor the pages for comments, followers and other stats?",
          answer: `Yes, your wonderful social media account manager is a ninja when
                it comes to monitoring comments, messages and reviews. We can
                take care of the replies for you and would surely reach out to
                you if we weren't sure how to reply.`
        },
        {
          question: "How soon will we see results?",
          answer: `Results can come quickly with our social media services. For
                example, many businesses post info on Instagram instead of
                engaging with followers by asking them questions. That language
                change, which is an invitation to your followers to chat, can be
                achieved in no time at all.`
