              Please let us know if you have a set budget and we will do our
              best to customize a value-for-money package for your business.
              We will quote you before work is started and also consult with

              We are big on SEO because it goes hand-in-hand with great

              website. We use proven SEO strategies, including image
              optimization, alt tagging, mobile-friendliness and keyword
              research help your site rank higher on Google and other search
              engines.

              Yes, the site is 100% yours. We assist with domain name

              the login details so you have full control of your site. We
              offer continued support, including website updates if required.
              We would love to have an ongoing business relationship with you
              but understand if you prefer to go solo after we complete the
              work. You will have the right to use graphics such as logos

              The more information we have, the better. Gather your photos,
              graphics, videos, written content and brand materials (logo,
              fonts and colors) and any ideas or vision you have for your new
              website. Once we collect the data, we check your content is
              relevant to the market you are targeting and SEO optimized. We
              also analyze images to make sure they deliver the right message
              and fit the design. If needed, we offer professional photography
              and videography services to make your business stand out from
              your competition.

            <p>
              We consult with the business owner or manager to clearly
              understand the message you want to send to clients online. We do
              in-depth research of your business online, including your
              competition, to evaluate what is working, what needs to be
              improved and what needs to be created. Most companies need work
              done in all three key areas. Identifying the goal is key (the
              analysis step mentioned above). We find out who your ideal
              market is and build a profile to refer to as we create the
              design and branding for your new website. Understanding your
              clients, industry and audience is key to building a successful
              website. We do the groundwork at the beginning to get the best
              results.
