          question: "What exactly is UX design ?",
          answer: `User experience (UX) design is an umbrella term representing the
                entire process of creating products and services that provide
                intuitive and delightful experience to their users. People
                widely use terms like “UI/UX Design” or “Usability Design” to
                represent User Experience Design. However UI (User Interface)
                Design and Usability Design are subsets of UX Design.`
        },
        {
          question: "How good User Experience can help businesses ?",
          answer: `For any business that delivers its service or product through an
                app or website, UX design is as critical as sales, branding or
                marketing. Because good UX design directly improves the bottom
                line. Even if it is a bank with brick and mortar branches all
                across the country, their app would be the most important
                channel in which customers interact with the business, making UX
                a critical factor influencing customer happiness and revenue.`
        },
        {
          question: "How much a typical UX design project would cost ?",
          answer: `There are multiple factors influencing the cost of a UX design
                project. The factors include scope and scale of the project,
                nature of the project (starting from scratch, revamping existing
                design), platforms (mobile, web, TV, kiosk), technology
                involved, and design services included (user research,
                interviews, testing) and delivery deadline to name a few. It's
                difficult to provide a number upfront without understanding the
                requirements and full scope of the project. We usually charge
                $35 to $50 per hour based on the complexity and size of the
                project.`
        },
        {
          question: "What is the timeline for a UX design project ?",
          answer: `All the factors influencing the cost (scope, complexity,
                platforms, budget, client feedback) will also affect the
                delivery timeline of a UX design project. A typical UX design
                project could go anywhere between 2-3 months to 6 months for a
                small-medium sized project. Bigger projects could take more than
                6 months to 1 year depending on the scope and complexity.`

              brainstorming session with all the stakeholders from the client
