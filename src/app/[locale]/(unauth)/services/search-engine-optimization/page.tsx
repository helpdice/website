          Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing your
          online content, so your targeted audience and potential clients
          can find you on the web. Most people start searching online using
          a search engine, and the majority use Google. We know the first
          five results generally get 67% of all clicks, so it's vital you
          are visible and near the top - actually, we always aim for the
          top!
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are not on page one, your chances of being discovered
          online are slim. Getting to the top of Google means investing time
          and money for most businesses and industries. Maintaining that top
          spot also requires constant work and effort. But being there is
          golden and comes with rewards.{' '}
